# Shirtwitches

## About

Shirtwitches is intended to be a repository of independent t-shirt designers who have created garments that are interesting, unique or otherwise appealing. This is mostly built for personal gain, as I am constantly searching out new and exciting t-shirt manufacterers as a hobby. However, I can see this website having relevance to others, as consumers are becoming increasingly concerned with where their clothing comes from. By buying from big name chain brands, often times, the designer is seperated from the fruits of their labour, either due to unfair payment processes or straight up art theft. Garment workers in other countries are unfairly exploited; forced to work long, grueling hours for poverty wages. In the western world, we have become too used to paying rock bottom prices for clothing that is poorly made out of cheap material through exploited labour, only to chuck it away after 1 or 2 wears. This is why I hope to focus on brands that are small enough to be held accountable, and fair to artists and garment workers. I believe that a really cool t-shirt should last for years, making a higher price point necessary and fair. 

While the problems I have highlighted above effect the entirity of the clothing industry (to say nothing of manufacturing as a whole), I will be keeping my focus on t-shirts. This is because there are only so many hours in the day and I'm not feeling very well at the moment, so don't want to bite off more than I can chew. T-shirts have a neigh on universal appeal. Who doesn't ever wear just 'jeans and a t-shirt'? They can be expressive; running the gambit from simple and plain, to high art, high concept, visually arresting designs. They can be suitable for work and every day wear, or so controversial that they can only be worn by the truly rebellious at heart. It does not matter what gender you define yourself as; t-shirts may use the language of gender to represent their fit sometimes, but it mostly comes down to personal preference. This has, often, meant that a greater range of body types are included. They make great gifts, can cover a huge range of personal styles and are often the comfiest, most useful item of clothing that can be in your wardrobe. 

It is due to these various qualities of the humble t-shirt that I want to include the following features in Shirtwitches.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

Why might a user visit this website? 
Other than doomscrolling, a user might visit Shirtwitches to try and discover new t-shirt brands that would fit their needs. They might want to see what I, a self proclaimed expert on such matters, have to say about their favourite t-shirt brand (or it might even be <i>their t-shirt</i> brand, who knows).

Why should this website exist?
Other than this is great practice for my frankly appauling coding skills, this website should be able to provide users with a good list of t-shirt companies that they may not have heard of before. Not only would this be helpful for the consumer, but I imagine it could be helpful for the businesses in question. There are a lot of websites out there and driving engagement is a big concern for small businesses. Its real hard for consumers to search for what they want, with search engines tending to prioritise large chain businesses, over smaller independent ones. A scientific study conducted by myself (NB: I googled 'cool t-shirt shops') has demonstrated that among the top results are Temu (a business that sells goods at frankly criminal prices and couldn't give a flying fuck about the environment or workers rights), links to custom t-shirt printing services (fine, but not exactly what I was looking for) and websites that use such obviously photoshopped images that you wouldn't have a clue what the product actually looks like. 

## Scope
Users should expect;
* Easy to navigate website design
* Visually appealing, reactive design that works across all devices
* Links and functions that work well
* Information on a variety of shops, with images and descriptions that help inform their choices

Users could want;
* The ability to search through the stores mentioned, in a way that would help them to view only those which match their needs such as finding a store that carries their size/matches their style/is not shit. 
* An entertaining experience; not trying to sell them anything unduly, providing reviews that are informative and fair, but are ultimately just, like, my opinion man.
* The ability to discuss the services/products provided, have a discussion with others. They might want this, I'm not sure yet if I will give it to them.

As a developer I want;
* To express my views about various t-shirt stores
* An excuse to buy more t-shirts

## Structure

## Design

### Surface
Me and my boyfriend have been discussing how much we miss Web 1.0 recently, so I would like to pay homage to the old internet, when any weirdo could crank out their own website on any gobshite they wanted and absolutely no one could stop them. A time before every website had be concerned with 'engagement' and 'influencers' or making money. When not everything used Corporate Memphis and Helvetica, and there was more cobbled together ugliness, and personal taste, and some badly rendered babies dancing in each corner. With that in mind, I have made the following design choices.

#### Colour

#### Typography
